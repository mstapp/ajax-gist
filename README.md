# ajax-gist

Users normally use an HTML `script` tag to embed GitHub Gists into a static web page. That doesn't work for dynamically-created pages, such as those created by jQuery, Backbone.js or Angular.js applications. This jQuery plugin allows applications to embed Gists into those dynamically-created HTML pages.

### Setup for using the plugin

If you just want to use the plugin (and not develop the plugin itself), just download the latest jquery.ajax-gist.js or jquery.ajax-gist.min.js file and include it in your HTML file via a `script` tag.

See **Usage,** below.
